## Macedonian Spellcheck Dictionary

This dictionary is ported from the [Open Office Macedonian dictionary extension](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/macedonian-spellchecker-dictionary) and originally developed by the [Free/Libre Software Organisation of Macedonia (OSSM)](https://www.slobodensoftver.org.mk/).

I've updated the `.aff` so that `hunspell` doesn't give an error.
